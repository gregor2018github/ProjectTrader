# Project Trader TODOs

## High Priority
- [ ] Transaction costs for buying and selling goods
- [ ] Player has only a limited amount of storage space
- [ ] Integrate the map system into the main game loop
- [ ] Collisions with objects in the world
- [ ] Houses must actually overlap the player (like trees now do in the map demo)

## Medium Priority
- [ ] Add a side menu panel with pictogram buttons
- [ ] Market events

## Planned Features
- [ ] Negative balance handling (e.g., loans)
- [ ] Bank Menu 
- [ ] Warehouse upgrades
- [ ] Price influenced by Supply and Demand
- [ ] Integrate a system to swap between different maps (e.g., town, house, shop)
- [ ] Revisite the Depot detail view window and add more statistics and graphs as soon as more game depth is implemented

## Bug Fixes
- [ ] Time progresses faster with higher frame rates, these two must be decoupled
- [ ] Make all sounds evenly loud (old trader voice is too silent)


Finished Features
- [x] Finish the depot view detail window
